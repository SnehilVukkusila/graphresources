# DATA STRUCTURES & ALGORITHMS

`Resources and Solutions` `^_^`

<!-- I am _Sachin Verma_ a student of Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Delhi,
an aspiring **Web Developer** and **Competitive Programmer**. -->

I have compiled many useful links for **Data Structures and Algorithms** questions and their solutions.  
I have also listed the **Theory Subjects**, which are often **ignored** by students but one must have a vast knowledge of them to help them in their interviews.  
I have also included the **Placement Ready Roadmap**, from `beginner level -> interview-ready candidate`

## üèÜ DSA Practice Resources

<p>
Remember: Deliberate practice does not mean looking for answers and memorizing them. You won't go very far with that approach. The more you are able to solve a problem yourself without any reference to answers, the more you will improve.
